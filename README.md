#### TYPOGRAPHY

The Mandalorian font is well recogised for its distinctive strong angles and cutout of the Mandalorian in the character A.

We sourced the font Mandalore from [dafonts](https://www.dafont.com/mandalore.font) and then converted the font to a WebFont Kit to allow the font to be used on our site using [transfonter](https://transfonter.org/).

To make the heading 'pop' we have styled it using the text-shadow attribute in the css which gives the font a bit more depth, and also added text-stroke to provide an outline around the text.
